Scoir Cluster
----------------

This repository contains Ansible Playbooks for clustered production instances.

Also see scoir/scoir_devops for a unified playbook containing a full stack.

##History
----------------
Initial creation was based on the Ansible Examples mongodb cluster. The structure of these playbooks will
eventually be merged with scoir_devops to provide a unified cluster stack playbook since the scoir_devops
playbook represents a basic deployment model.

##Resources
----------------

###mongodb
The mongodb cluster requires 3 nodes.
